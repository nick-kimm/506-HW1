Looked up some functions and syntax online to answer some questions. Ex. Syntax of if statement inside for loop  

##Problem 1

Part a: Loading data
```{r}
wine <- read.csv("/Users/nicholaskim/Documents/STAT 506/hw1/wine.data",header = FALSE)

wine_names <- list('Wine Type','Alchohol','Malic Acid','Ash','Alcalinity of Ash','Magnesium','Total Phenols','Flavanoids','Nonflavanoid Phenols','Proanthocyanins','Color Intensity','Hue','OD280/OD315','Proline' )

colnames(wine) <- wine_names

wine
```

Part b: Checking if count of wine type matches that noted in wine_name text file
```{r}
as.data.frame(table(wine$`Wine Type`))
```
From doc we expect to see 59 for Type 1, 71 for Type 2, and 48 for Type 3. From table above we can see it matches!

Part c: Q1. What is the correlation b/t alcohol and color intensity?
```{r}
cor(wine$Alchohol,wine$`Color Intensity`)
```
The correlation between these two variables is 54.64%

Q2. Which class has the highest correlation? Which has the lowest?
```{r}

```

Q3. What is the alcohol content of the wine with the highest color intensity?
```{r}
for (x in 1:length(wine$`Wine Type`)){
  if (wine[x,11] == max(wine$`Color Intensity`)){
    alc = wine[x,2]
  }
}
alc
```
The alcohol content of the wine w/ the highest Color Intensity is 14.34%.

Q4. What percentage of wines had a higher content of proanthocyanins compare to ash?
```{r}
count = 0

for (x in 1:length(wine$`Wine Type`)){
  if (wine[x,10] > wine[x,4]){
    count = 1+count
  }
}

count/178*100
```
The percentage of wines that had a higher content of Proanthocyanins compared to Ash was 8.4%

Part d: Create a table identifying the average value of each variable, providing one row for the overall average, and one row per class with class averages.
```{r}

```

Part e: Carry out a series of t-tests to examine whether the level of phenols differs across the three classes. Present the R output and interpret the results.
```{r}

```
